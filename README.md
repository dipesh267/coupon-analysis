#Analysis of drivers accepting coupons


7. Based on these observations, what do you hypothesize about drivers who accepted the bar coupons?
Total portion of the bar coupons accepted overall = 41.0%
Total percentage of customers who accepted coupons and went to bar less than 3 of fewer times = 86.93%
Total percentage of customers who accepted coupons and went to bar more than 3 times = 12.3%
Total acceptance for drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and over the age of 25 - 71.65%
Total acceptance for drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and under the age of 25 - 28.35%
Total acceptance for drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had no kids as passenger, and not in farming, fishing, or forestry - 94.56%
Total acceptance for drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had kids as passenger, and not in farming, fishing, or forestry - 5.44%
Acceptance for people who go to bars more than once a month and under the age of 30 = 143.16% %
Hypothesis - It seems drivers who don't frequently go to bars are attracted by coupons to the bars and hence tend to accept the coupons more.
It also seems that drivers under the age of 25 are more ready to accept Bar coupons than drivers of ages above 25. Having kids in the car also
seem to deter drivers from accepting Bar coupons probably becaseu of the child factor
