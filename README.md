# Analysis of coupons offered to drivers

The goal of this project is to analyze the various types of coupons offered to drivers and their acceptance with respect to the types of coupons offered, the direction of their travel, proximity to locations for which the coupons were offered for etc.

Of all types of coupons offered, I'd like to look at coupons offered for Bars and Coffee Houses. Before we dive into it, just looking at high level aspect of coupons accepted, I wanted to see if age played any factor with acceptance.

As we look at the age relationship, we can see that the drivers under the age of 25 are most likely to accpet coupons in general than the other age groups.
